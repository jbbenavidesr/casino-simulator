Welcome to Casino Simulator's documentation!
============================================

**Casino Simulator** is a Python application that simulates some casino games. This
project is made for learning the principles of Object Oriented Design by following this
excellent book `Building Skills in Object-Oriented Design <https://slott56.github.io/building-skills-oo-design-book/>`_.
The book guides the reader through the design process of a casino simulation where the
author describes the general steps and thinking process of designing a system. The
author doesn't provide any code, just explains the design and provides a set of deliverables
that the reader should implement in Python and build it using all the best practices
of a software project: unit tests, documentation and clean code.

This documentation will be my personal notes and reflections of the book and the
project. I'll be adding more content as I go. I'll give my own overview of the
problem to be implemented and my own thoughts on the design process.

.. note::

   This project is still in development. I'm still working on the book and the
   project. I'll be adding more content as I go.
