Welcome to Casino Simulator's documentation!
============================================

**Casino Simulator** is a Python application that simulates some casino games. This
project is made for learning the principles of Object Oriented Design by following this
excellent book `Building Skills in Object-Oriented Design <https://slott56.github.io/building-skills-oo-design-book/>`_.

In the process I'll learn a lot of design and general princples of building good software,
including Documentation and Testing.

.. note::

   This is a work in progress and a learning project. I'll be adding more games and features as I go.
