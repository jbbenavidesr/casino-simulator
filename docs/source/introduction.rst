Introduction
============

This project is the implementation of a casino simulator. The idea is to be able to
model different games and different strategies and see how they perform against each
other.

The project will implement simulations for three popular casino games: Blackjack,
Roulette and Craps. The project will also implement a number of different betting
strategies for each game and finally implement a CLI to run the simulations and
test the strategies.
