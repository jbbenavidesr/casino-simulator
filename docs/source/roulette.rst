Roulette
========

Roulette is a simple game of chance. The player places a bet on a number or a combination
of numbers, and then spins the wheel. If the ball lands on the number or combination of
numbers the player bet on, the player wins.

The game is played with a wheel that has 38 slots, numbered 0 to 36. The numbers 1 to 36
are alternately colored red and black, with 0 and 00 colored green. The colors of the
slots are not relevant to the game.

The player places a bet on a number or combination of numbers. The player can bet on a
single number, any combination of two adjacent numbers, the rows 1 to 12, 13 to 24, or
25 to 36, odd or even, red or black, or 1 to 18 or 19 to 36.
