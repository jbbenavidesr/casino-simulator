# Casino simulator

This is a basic application that simulates different betting strategies used at three different casino games:

- Roulette
- Craps
- Blackjack

This is done as part of my studies of OOD and following the ideas in [this book.](https://slott56.github.io/building-skills-oo-design-book/).
